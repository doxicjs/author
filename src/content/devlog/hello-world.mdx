## On automations

<SubTitle>Humans make mistakes</SubTitle>

> Automations are essential for a sustainable development environment. I'm always trying to keep consistency when it comes to file naming, structuring and all that. Automated file creations are so far saving a lot of time and resource.

Feeling great after setting up Obsidian.md templates successfully. First setup I created was the template using an Obsidian plugin called `Templater`. Purpose of this template was to help me embed YAML frontmatter (smartly) and increment issue numbers (assign ids) with just a click.

This document was in fact created with the said template.

### Disadvantages

<SubTitle>Ah, there's the catch...</SubTitle>

```tsx title="Hello world!"
import { dxText } from '../dx/text'

export default function Fluid(props: { text: string }) {
  return (
    <p class={dxText('fluid-paragraph-01', 'text-neutral-12 mt-6')}>
      {props.text}
    </p>
  )
}
```

> All software needs an update at some point

First of all, automations may or may not depend on other software. When that software version _expires_ there's the worry of checking if the version update breaks your automation. Not only do you have to worry about keeping your own environment up-to-date but also keep track of your automation files.

Secondly, you either have to write an automation that is hard to break (has validations) or write an automation so small that you can rewrite it back.

- Who are we?
- What is that?
- How are you?
- Where are they?
- When is it?

### Solution?

<SubTitle>There's always a way</SubTitle>

Currently, I'm thinking of a way to create automations in a modular way. Small components, small functions that is easy to rewrite and helps composing such automations easier.
