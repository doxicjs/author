## On Doxic

Some might say we're leaning heavily on bleeding edge technologies of the day and there will be breaking changes along the way. They are correct in a sense that it's important to anchor your project on a dependable framework from the beginning and especially if it's a *scalable* and *long term supported* project.

Well, to be honest: Right now, I haven't got any clues on how things will go but all I have is an idea and a desire to fulfill them.

## On Daily Notes
<Label text="Notes are the first embodiment of an idea" />

>Keep them open, especially during heavy workdays. It helps when there's many ideas that's distracting you from your *priority* work.

Now we can focus and who knows, maybe even re-use our notes.

One of the capabilities of **Obsidian.md** is that we can use backlinks as a way to refer to an idea that we had maybe yesterday. Instead of trying to blow a single document with multiple idea (which also takes time organizing idea in the first place), we can link them. So essentially, we blowing up this one topic, a key with ideas. It can improve upon it, maybe some will take a step backwards but in the end, it's all there when we're ready to crunch on Doxic.

## On the importance of DX
<Label text="Just a REALLY good environment, really" />

>Developer feedback is an important resource for Doxic since it's for developers. As the first user of Doxic, I'll keep track of my experience using Doxic, suggest features, file issues.

I'm hoping to build an open-source community around Doxic. Developers with shared philosophy of building fast, lightweight, scalable web. Even though I'm not experienced creating, maintaining or even heavily contributing to an open-source project, I'm getting a feeling that it's about first-impression and following instructions on handling certain situations. Since we're humans and not machines, we won't be able to follow instructions for a long time. So it's important to build a *culture* around the developers contributing to the project.
*%%I got really excited writing this%%*

## Words before I...
<Label text="Use the document for daily note taking" />

>I'm excited to be writing once more.

Lately, I've been having so much thoughts, wandering and exploring many ideas to the point where I believe I might have ADHD. Since I'm not officially diagnosed or anything, I'll just have to adapt myself better in this new time by writing and linking ideas together without any worries of losing track of them.

I'm also having trouble with speaking clearly or difficulty expressing myself and my ideas to others. I believe that's due to having so many aspects, variables just floating in my head and it's hard to catch them while having to deal with emotions and filter words with social standarts.

**Lack of organization is limiting my freedom to be.**

And so, I will not let it.
